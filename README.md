A software developer, often found cracking edge cases, nesting callbacks and scouring docs for matchers.

Interested in how technology can be used to solve inefficiencies through a combination of creative and technical means, I've worked across applications that have challenged how Europe handles accounts management and digitised logistics in the shipping industry.

## SKILLS

**Initiative**

I am proactive when it comes to finding ways to improve productivity and increase value. It's this quality that has driven many of my choices in both my work and study - seeking scholarships in China and the US as an undergraduate and more recently, successfully pitching ideas to brands like Warner Music Group and Illva Saronno.

## PERSONAL PROJECTS
Project | Description | Technologies | Testing | Duration
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[RoadtoCode](https://github.com/road-to-code/road-to-code) | Given a brief to build a game that would introduce children to the foundations of programming, our team of four junior developers made Road to Code - an interactive grid-based game that requires the player to get across a map by programming directions for their character to follow. Interested in the challenge, we decided against using any frameworks. Instead, we wrote each line of code and favoured vanilla JavaScript for our frontend. | JavaScript, Sinatra, PostgreSQL | Jasmine, Mocha, ZombieJS | 8 Days
[CodeyGonzalez](https://github.com/mjosephmiller/codey-gonzalez) | Participating in a three-day developer-tool hackathon, our team of five junior developers, aimed to improve coders' speed, accuracy and familiarity with best-practice formatting.  Defining our MVP early, we implemented agile development to deliver the product on time and to specification. Find it on [Heroku](http://codey-gonzalez.herokuapp.com/). | JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL | RSpec, Capybara, Poltergeist | 3 Days
[nodeAbode](https://github.com/mjosephmiller/makersbnb) | Tasked with creating an AirBnb clone in a team of three, we picked up and implemented a number of technologies that were completely new to us at the time, including Node, Sequelize and ZombieJS | Node, Sequelize | ZombieJS | 4 Days

## INTERESTS

I'm a regular attendee on the meetup circuit (TwitterDev, Silicon Drinkabout and have even been known to attend a Saturday morning Katathon). When I'm not debugging, refactoring or otherwise getting to grips with the latest technologies, I love to get outdoors. I'm a keen swimmer and a slightly less enthusiastic runner, though I did struggle through the London Marathon this year -
*I'm nothing if not persevering.*
